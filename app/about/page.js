            Hello! My name is Parker Siu and I am a software engineer who is passionate about technology and engineering.
            While pursuing my bachelor&apos;s degree in economics, I spent much of my free time flight training and earned a commercial
            pilot license. Aviation opened my eyes to a world of engineering and software technology that I have become fascinated with.
            Technology is paramount for safety in aviation, and the innovations in software over the last 10 years are incalculable.
            A large focus in flight training is on the aviator&apos;s decision making. This involves solving complex problems, often under
            high stress workloads that flying an airplane demands. Problem solving quickly became a strength of mine, and this is one of the
            first things that drew me into software development. I attended a coding bootcamp to improve my technical skills in front end and
            back end languages/techonologies. Since graduating, I have been working on personal projects to further increase my skills and I invite you
            to please view these projects from the links above. If you would like to speak with me, please fill out the contact form.
